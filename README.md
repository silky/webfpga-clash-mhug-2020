# Simple examples of Clash for on the WebFPGA board

Examples are around the onboard LED and Neopixel.


### Requirements

- Clash (tested on v1.2.4)

In order to deploy to the WebFPGA board, you can either use their
[WebIDE](https://webfpga.io/), or run the entire setup locally.

I've hacked together a working environment by using the [webfpga
cli](https://github.com/webfpga/cli.git) to flash, and running a
local hacked version of [icestorm
server](https://github.com/silky/icestorm-server).
